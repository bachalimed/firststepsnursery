 notes on system operation

1. if a completely new student, proceed with adding new student, if a studetn already in the system for another year, from studetnsList, select the row and click register.
a dialog will open to Register the studetn by selecting the current year. now the studetn will be visible when we add admission
2. for new admission, the Admission field, will have all months selected except July and August ( summer club months).
3. for a new service, add preferably all months from teh start so that the studetn will be visible for enrolment later.
4. if a studetn is not admitted for a specific month for a service, he will not appear for enrolment for that month. a list of unenrolled studetns is availble to check if studetn s ar enot admitted or not enrolled.
5. invoices are generated automatically from enrolments (filter non invoices enrolment and generte invoice), and then we can make changes to them from the list of invoices. we can only change the due dates and apply discountsbut if we need to change the amount (long term), we need to delte invoice and edit the enrolment and then generate another invoice. but htis wouild need to wait for authorisatin if the amount is less than anchor.
6. discounts are applied directly onteh final price and will appear on the invoice list
7. there is no ppppayment editing, we should remove a payment and create a new payment a again ( avoid changes of past payments)
8. we create a new employee and we can edit employee and choose roles for employee(animator, desk, academic...)
